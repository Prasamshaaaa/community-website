            <h1>ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY</h1>
            <p class="large-text"><b>The Paradise is situated at the Northern part of California.But in Sociology, Society refers not to a group of people but to the complex pattern of the norms or interaction or relationships that arise among them. People exist only as an agent of social relationships. Mere congregation of individuals does not constitute society. Rather society refers to the complicated network of social relationships by which every individual is interrelated with his fellowmen. Hence Society is abstract, not concrete, in nature. We can’t touch it but fill it. Because society resides in the minds of individual.

                Society is a process of living not a thing, a motion rather than structure. A system of social relationships is the most important aspect of society. Not all relationships are social. A social relationship implies reciprocal awareness among individuals. This reciprocal awareness direct and indirect are the characteristic of every social relationship. This idea of reciprocal awareness is implied in F.H. Giddings definition of society i.e. “a number of like-minded individuals, who know and enjoy their like-mindedness and are, therefore, able to work together for common ends.” Thus elements of society exists in the ‘Consciousness of Kind’ of Giddings, ‘we feeling’ of Cooley or ‘a common propensity of W.I. Thomas.
